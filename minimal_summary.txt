CURRENT STATE:
==============

The scheduler is reverted to its original simple implementation.

ONLY ONE CHANGE KEPT:
- Worker affinity: Hash-based distribution of CPU containers to prevent hot-spotting

AVAILABLE BUT NOT USED:
- BatchUpdateWorkerCapacity() method exists in repository
- Can be used later if needed with proper approach

REVERTED / REMOVED:
- Batch request processing
- Worker state caching
- Complex integration test
- scheduler_batch.go file

REASON FOR REVERT:
- "invalid worker resource version" errors from stale cache
- Too heavy-handed, complete rewrite of scheduling flow
- Not what was asked for

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Original one-at-a-time request processing
- Direct GetAllWorkers() calls (no cache)
- Worker affinity for better distribution
- No breaking changes

Ready for proper benchmarking to identify actual bottleneck.
