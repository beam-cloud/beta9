# Clip v2 Mount Issue - Proper Fix

## The Problem

When running containers from v2 archives, you encountered:
```
error mounting "proc" to rootfs at "/proc": finding existing subpath of "proc": 
wandered into deleted directory "/dev/shm/build-f744960d/layer-0/merged/proc"
```

## The Real Root Cause

You were absolutely right to question the "wait for stabilization" approach - **v1 never needed that**, so v2 shouldn't either.

The real issue is simpler:

### V1 Flow (Why it worked):
1. `umoci.Unpack` extracts image to real directory
2. **Creates `/workspace`, `/volumes` during unpack**
3. Real directories exist on disk
4. Overlay mounts on top → works perfectly

### V2 Flow (Why it failed):
1. ClipFS FUSE mount provides virtual rootfs (no extraction)
2. **Never creates `/workspace`, `/volumes`** - they don't exist unless in the image
3. FUSE mount is read-only, can't create directories
4. Overlay tries to mount → **fails because required directories missing**

## The Proper Fix

**Create required directories in the overlay's upper (writable) layer**, not in the read-only FUSE mount.

### Code Changes

In `pkg/common/overlay.go`, **before** mounting the overlay:

```go
// Create required directories in the upper layer
requiredDirs := []string{"workspace", "volumes", "proc", "sys", "dev", "tmp"}
for _, dir := range requiredDirs {
    upperPath := filepath.Join(upperDir, dir)
    os.MkdirAll(upperPath, 0755)
}
```

Then the overlay mount happens, and these directories are available in the merged view.

## Why This is the Right Fix

✅ **Consistent with v1**: Same behavior, just at a different point  
✅ **No waiting/hacks**: No timeouts or stabilization needed  
✅ **Proper layering**: Writable layer contains writable additions  
✅ **FUSE-agnostic**: Works whether lower layer is FUSE or real directory  
✅ **Clean**: Directories appear in overlay where they're needed  

## How Overlay Works

```
Lower (FUSE mount - read-only): /usr, /bin, /lib, ...
       ↓
Upper (writable layer): /workspace, /volumes, /proc, /sys, /dev, /tmp
       ↓
Merged (union): Everything from both layers
       ↓
Container sees: Complete filesystem with all directories
```

When you create a directory in the upper layer **before** mounting the overlay, it appears in the merged view, regardless of whether it exists in the lower layer.

## Why v1 Didn't Need This in Overlay

In v1, these directories were created during `umoci.Unpack` **in the lower layer** (the extracted rootfs). By the time overlay mounted, they already existed in the lower layer.

In v2, there's no unpack step, so the lower layer (FUSE) only has what's in the OCI image. Our required directories must be in the upper layer instead.

## Testing

With this fix, you should see:

```
worker INF detected v2 (OCI) archive format
worker INF mounted layer container_id=xxx layer_index=0
worker INF container is now running container_id=xxx
```

**No errors about "wandered into deleted directory"**

## Files Modified

- `pkg/common/overlay.go`: Create required directories in upper layer before mount
- `pkg/worker/image.go`: Removed hacky wait/stabilization code

## Summary

The fix is simple and clean:
1. Create required directories in overlay's upper layer
2. Mount overlay
3. Container sees complete filesystem
4. Everything works

No waiting, no hacks, just proper layering. ✅
