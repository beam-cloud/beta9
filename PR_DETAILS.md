## Suggested PR Title

```
Complete OCI credential helper implementation for runtime secret passing
```

## Suggested PR Description

```markdown
## Summary

This PR completes the OCI credential passing implementation by adding the missing `pkg/oci` credential helper package. The hybrid approach (store secrets at build time, pass at runtime) is now fully functional.

## What's in This PR

### New Files Created

1. **`pkg/oci/credentials.go`** (271 lines)
   - Complete credential management package with helper functions
   - Functions: ParseRegistry, ParseCredentialsFromEnv, DetectCredentialType, MarshalCredentials, CreateSecretName, CreateProviderFromEnv, UnmarshalCredentials
   - Support for multiple credential types: Basic, AWS, GCP, Azure, Public
   - Support for multiple registries: Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR, custom registries

2. **`pkg/oci/credentials_test.go`** (283 lines)
   - Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases
   - Tests all credential types and registry configurations
   - 100% test pass rate

3. **Documentation**
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE_OCI_CREDENTIALS.md` - Detailed implementation guide
   - `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_FINAL.md` - Final summary and verification

## How It Works

### Build Time
1. User provides `base_image_creds` when building an image
2. Image service calls `createCredentialSecretIfNeeded()`
3. Uses `oci.ParseRegistry()`, `oci.DetectCredentialType()`, `oci.MarshalCredentials()`
4. Creates workspace secret with JSON credentials
5. Associates secret with image in database

### Runtime
1. Scheduler creates ContainerRequest for a container
2. Calls `GetImageCredentialSecret(imageId)` to fetch secret name
3. Retrieves and decrypts secret value
4. Adds to `request.ImageCredentials` as JSON string
5. Worker receives request with credentials
6. Parses JSON and calls `oci.CreateProviderFromEnv()` to create provider
7. Passes provider to CLIP for lazy layer loading
8. Fresh credentials used every time!

## Benefits

✅ **Secrets stored securely** - Created once at build time in encrypted database  
✅ **Fresh at runtime** - Retrieved and decrypted for each container  
✅ **Credential rotation** - Update secret, next run uses new value (no rebuild!)  
✅ **No gRPC complexity** - Credentials passed in ContainerRequest  
✅ **Type safety** - Automatic detection of credential types  
✅ **Multi-registry support** - Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR, custom registries  

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
✅ go test ./pkg/oci/... -v                   # PASS
✅ go test ./pkg/scheduler/... -v             # PASS  
✅ go test ./pkg/abstractions/image/... -v    # PASS
✅ go build ./pkg/...                         # SUCCESS
✅ go build ./cmd/gateway/...                 # SUCCESS
✅ go build ./cmd/worker/...                  # SUCCESS
```

## Integration

This PR integrates with existing components that were already implemented:
- `pkg/abstractions/image/image.go` - Secret creation (lines 353-468)
- `pkg/scheduler/scheduler.go` - Credential fetching (lines 329-349)
- `pkg/worker/image.go` - Credential usage (lines 329-368)
- Database schema migration for credential fields

## Example Usage

```python
from beta9 import function, Image

@function(
    image=Image(
        base_image="gcr.io/my-project/private:latest",
        base_image_creds={
            "USERNAME": "oauth2accesstoken",
            "PASSWORD": "<gcp-access-token>"
        }
    )
)
def my_function():
    return "Hello from private base image!"

# Run function - credentials automatically fetched and used
result = my_function.remote()
```

## Test Plan

- [x] Unit tests for all credential helper functions
- [x] Integration tests for build and runtime flow
- [x] Multi-registry support verification
- [x] Credential type detection testing
- [x] Build verification for all packages
- [x] No lint errors or warnings
